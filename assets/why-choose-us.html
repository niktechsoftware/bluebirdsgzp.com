					<p>TERI Prakriti School aims to be a regular 10+2 CBSE school that goes way beyond to give our children education that is relevant, meaningful, sustainable and learning intensive.  A place that is fun filled, where lifelong learning is focused making the learner a confidant human being. In a rapidly changing world where simple domain skills are becoming irrelevant, the context of our learning will not only be deeply rooted in our Indian culture but will also respond to the ever changing needs of the global fitment and challenge. The journey of learning throughout will reflect the journey of the school's and family's ever conscious responses that will be the demand of the times to come. Some of our key strengths are reflected in:</p>                    
					
                    
                    <h3>Day care</h3>
                    
                    <p>As a parent, you want to ensure that your child is safe and happy in a childcare environment that is fun, educational, and nurturing. Teri Prakriti school daycare is a storehouse of faith and congruence, where you leave your children safe in the lap of nature and knowledge. We allow across-age group and sibling-like bonding. Environment at Teri Prakriti School strengthens the importance of relationships; compassion and co-habitation, which are vital life and futuristic skills. It is another home for the child, personalized to house each child's needs. Our daycare caregivers are all certified professionals with a good background in care-giving and early learning.</p>
<p>Our daily schedule for children includes a number of enriching activities through play way method to make sure that the children spend their time industriously. Children engage in age-and interest-appropriate group activities that foster their language, cognitive, social and emotional skills.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>We take extra care to customize the program to each child's individual needs. For example: flexible entry-exit timings, sleep patterns, diet constraints, age-specific enrichment etc. </li>
    <li>Our day care facilities include a quality-controlled kitchen and rigorous sanitization procedures to ensure a safe, comfortable, and clean environment for kids.</li>
    <li>Nutritionally-balanced snacks and lunches are served to children.</li>
    <li>The above facility comes to you with additional payment on an hourly basis.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span>Campus as a live lab</span></h3>

<p>Economic progress and growth worldwide is sustainability linked. The Teri Prakriti School is beautifully located in lush green environment of 100 acres that offers unmatched greenery and a clean environment. The school is a live lab for:</p>
<p><strong>Green School Building:</strong> Good indoor quality, energy efficient lighting, local building materials, non-toxic options for paints</p>
<p><strong>Energy Conservation:</strong> Conserving energy by using natural lighting for classroom lights, fans, lights in the corridor</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Footprint:</strong> Measuring the total impact of the school on the environment-energy usage, transport, garden, paper, food, furniture and water</p>
<p><strong>Managing and Conserving Water:</strong> Minimizing wastage, conserving and managing water in toilets, drinking area, gardens, and play grounds</p>
<p><strong>Green Campus:</strong>  Growing and nurturing plants for a green environment </p>
<p><strong>Green Neighbourhood:</strong> Working hand in hand with neighbouring community for green surroundings</p>
<p><strong>Renewable Energy Options:</strong> Solar panel and lights for the outdoors, solar geysers for the school washrooms and kitchen</p>
<p><strong>Solid Waste Management:</strong> Managing school waste -minimizing, segregating, recycling, reusing and disposing in correct manner</p>

<h3><span>Mindfulness in Education:</span></h3>

<p>Mindfulness in education is to help students learn to focus and pay attention. It facilitates the development of social and emotional competence and positive emotions. The school's curriculum is designed in a manner that cultivates positive attitude and highlights a set of mental skills and socio-emotional dispositions that are central to the aims of education in the 21st century. These include skills associated with emotion and attention, self-esteem, and pro-social dispositions such as empathy and compassion. The inclusion of systematic contemplative practices in our curriculum, induces changes in brain function and structure, supports pro-social behavior and ensures academic success in young mindful students.</p>

<h3><span>Sporting as a way of life:</span></h3>

<p>Being good at sports is as important as being a sport. A sport is a key to living that engages not only hands and legs but also mind and intellect. While hands and legs take care of our well-being, the mind and intellect is all about happy living. It is clichéd to hear sound mind in a sound body but physical fitness is a key to good productive and successful life. In fact the economic progress of a country is primarily dependent on the health and well-being of its citizens. Hence, physical development is a key area of focus at the school. In addition, competitive sports would also be integral to the system. Not to mention other advantages of team spirit, collaborative instincts and winning as a mindful activity.Being good at sports is as important as being a sport.

<h3><span>A new way to learn- Focus on futuristic skills</span></h3>

<p>In future, education is not just what you know but what you do with what you know. With people living longer, machines becoming smarter, huge data generation, new ways of social networking, global connectivity and visual media power, a futuristic learner would require skills such as:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Social intelligence for healthy interaction with people and the society</li>
<li>Adaptive and workable thinking for solutions that are feasible and innovative</li>
<li>Cross cultural competency for working in different cultural settings</li>
<li>Computational skills for reasoning and translating data into concepts </li>
<li>Communication skills with different backdrops of media</li>
<li>Multitasking with skill of prioritizing</li>
<li>Collaborative skills for real and virtual world </li>
<li>Trans-disciplinary skills for understanding concepts from diverse fields</li>
<li>Analytical skills for sense making</li>
<li>Leadership skills for driving an idea into a possibility</li>

</ul>
<p>Attempt is made to realize the above skills through an approach that is project based, inter-disciplinary and cross-cultural. The importance to integrate the understanding of the socio-economic development, sustainability and inclusive society is kept in mind while designing the delivery of the curriculum. This requires highly trained teachers and a programme to do that on a continuous basis is in place. </p>

<h3><span>Duties and citizenship</span></h3>

<p>While it is important to be aware of the rights as a citizen of a free country, it is equally critical to understand the stated duties. The interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross- cultural skills are critical for character and citizenship development of a child. These are given an additional focus and delivered as a part of the integrated curriculum.</p>
