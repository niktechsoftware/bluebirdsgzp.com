ASSESSMENT OF CO-SCHOLASTIC AREAS – DESCRIPTIVE INDICATORS

Life Skills (Part 2A)

Life Skills are abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life. They are abilities that facilitate the physical, mental and emotional well-being of individuals. 

‘Adaptive’ means that a person is flexible in approach and able to adjust to different circumstances. 

‘Positive behavior’ implies that a person is forward looking and finds a ray of hope, solution and opportunities even in difficult situations. 

Life Skills are abilities that will help students to be successful in living a productive life. Learning and practicing Life Skills help students to improve their personal and social qualities. 

There are a large number of Life Skills emanating from various sources, and the total list is very large. For practical purposes and for feasibility, we have chosen ten Life Skills as given in the table below. Although a life skill may transgress more than one domain, each life skill has a dominant feature. Further, there are overlapping processes, e.g. problem solving and decision making. All problem solving involves decision making. 

We have classified the life skills according to their dominant features in the following table. 

Life Skills Matrix

                                       10. Dealing with stress - - 

Although all or most of the Life Skills can be measured by standardized tests and inventories, such skills can also be reasonably assessed on the basis of displayed behavior by the student. We have provided a few sampled observable behaviors pertaining to thinking, social and emotional skills. 

As mentioned earlier, students will be assessed in these domains on the basis of their overt behavior. We will take three different courses of action to build in objectivity and reliability: 

Day-to-day observation
Rating at the end of the term 
Annual Assessment 


Day to day observation:

Please keep ‘a watchful eye’ on your student, whenever you notice a significant behavior that may shed light on any one of the thirty (30) descriptors under the three domains. Record it in your diary. It should not be time bound; it should be as and when such a thing happens. Here are a few examples. 

Rohan shared his tiffin with his friends today 
Jiten gulped his tiffin quickly and then looked at others 
Though Sara did not figure in the list of awardees, she was all smiles and helped me in organizing the event 
George visited his sick classmate at home and briefed him about the work done in class as well as the assignments 
Sarbari differed with my viewpoint; she argued but never got irritated; but Shanti got angry because Sarbari was arguing with me 
Mohammad connected the computer to the LCD projector, set the screen so proficiently that I could use it in the classroom 

While you rate such behavior, please remember ‘5’ stands for desirable behavior and less than ‘1’ for the undesirable one. For example in the above case Sarbari gets ‘5’, but Shanti gets ‘2’ or ‘1’. Although you would observe on a day to day basis and record, you would accumulate it at the end of the term and then convert into a grade.

All these statements reveal certain styles of behavior of a student, e.g. effective communication of Sarbari, excellent interpersonal skills exhibited by Mohammad and Sara’s ability to manage her emotions, etc. 
Also refer to the Life Skill’s Manual for teachers brought out by CBSE for classes IX and X. It has a few exemplar activities for all Life Skills which teachers can do with their students. Others can also be created by the teachers themselves. 

Rating at the end of the term: In the following pages, we present the behavioral descriptors for each of the Co-Scholastic dimensions. Human behavior, as you know, is not a binary function; does not appear in ‘yes’ or ‘no’. It differs in degrees. Hence, rate each behavior on five-point scale once in a session–
                                
                                                   Grade                                               Grade Points 
                                                      A                                                        4.1 - 5.0 
                                                      B                                                        3.1 - 4.0 
                                                      C                                                        2.1 - 3.0 
                                                      D                                                        1.1 - 2.0 
                                                      E                                                         0 -1.0 

How to calculate Grades in Co-Scholastic Areas 

1. Each student will be graded on each of the 03 Life Skills, Work Education, Visual and Performing Arts, 03 Attitudes, Values, 02 Co-curricular Activities and 02 Health and Physical Education (HPE) activities. 
2. Maximum score for each Life Skill, Work Education and Visual and Performing Arts and Attitudes is 50, for Values is 200 and for Co-curricular Activities and HPE is 50. 
3. Before assigning the Grades on each component using the conversion table, please calculate the average or grade points by dividing the total score obtained by a student by number of items in that component. For example, for a student who has a score of 35 in Thinking Skills; you need to divide it by the number of descriptors, i.e. 10; the average or grade point is 3.5; hence grade is B. 
4. A Sample Sheet to calculate grades in Co-Scholastic Areas is given after the discussion of the indicators.

5b. Health and Physical Education (Part 3B)
Proper development of the body is essential for the healthy growth of the mind. It is therefore, necessary that the students should be examined by qualified doctors once in the session along with a follow-up session. If this facility is not available general information about health i.e. height & weight, etc. could be obtained by the teacher. There are already, age and gender related charts of height and weight. Teachers should use these charts and note observations on the basis of entries he/she makes on the Report Book / Certificate of School Based Assessment (SBA).
In addition to this general information, physical disabilities and diseases e.g. defective vision, maintenance of teeth, deafness, long absence due to illness, which the teacher can detect at one’s own level, should also be noted. He/she should also bring any noticeable deformity of the child in the notice of the parents. In the assessment of Health Status, the recordings of height shall be in centimeters and the weight shall be mentioned in kilograms. The Health Manuals (in four volumes) brought out by CBSE must be referred to and the graded activities taken up as part of the curriculum in schools. Moreover features of Health Promoting Schools, format of Health Cards and the themes and Annexures must be adhered to. 
The suggested format of Health Cards has also been given in the Comprehensive School Health Manual (Volume I). The Health Card records the history in terms of health for all learners from the time of admission in the school, till the time they leave. While the area of Physical Education of the curriculum will be judging the skills and proficiencies acquired by the students in games, sports etc. the area of Health Education will concentrate on those aspects which constitute the criteria for determining the physical health of an individual. The following aspects will be taken care of in this area.
Health Education needs to be assessed on the basis of: 
􀂄 Basic understanding about health 
􀂄 Physical fitness 
􀂄 Attitude development 
􀂄 Participation in Health and Wellness Club activities The teacher’s responsibility in this area will be limited to general observations. These must be communicated to the parents and guardians for all students. We divided this domain into two segments. One is rating certain Health and Physical Education related behaviors, and second is information on actual participation in Physical Education, Sports and Games. General descriptors for HPE are given for appraising a student on any specific activity, these general guideline may be modified accordingly.
