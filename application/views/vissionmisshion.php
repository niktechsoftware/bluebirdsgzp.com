            <h2>MISSION</h2> 

The New School prepares students to understand, contribute to, and succeed in a rapidly changing society, thus making the world a better and more just place. We will ensure that our students develop both the skills a sound education provides and the competencies essential for success and leadership in the emerging creative economy. We will also lead in generating practical and theoretical knowledge that enables people to better understand our world and improve conditions for local and global communities.

 <h2>VISION</h2>

We are and will be a school where design and social research drive approaches to studying issues of our time, such as democracy, urbanization, technological change, economic empowerment, sustainability, migration, and globalization. We will be the preeminent intellectual and creative center for effective engagement in a world that increasingly demands better-designed objects, communication, systems, and organizations to meet social needs.

Our vision aligns with shifts in the global economy, society, and environment, which animate our mission and our values:

Creativity, innovation, and a desire to challenge the status quo, both in what and how we teach and in the intellectual ambitions of the school itself
Social engagement, orienting students' academic experiences to help them become critically engaged citizens dedicated to solving problems and contributing to the public good
The Blue Birds International School must embrace these principles and innovate to address shifts in the global economy, society, and environment that require individuals to grapple with complex problems, pursue more fluid and flexible career pathways, and collaboratively create change.


<h2>EDUCATIONAL APPROACH</h2>
We will fulfill our mission by extending The New School's legacy as a non-traditional university and community, nimble and responsive to change, that:

Focuses on and engages with critical contemporary issues
Prioritizes humanity and culture in designing systems and environments to improve the human condition, an approach that draws on design thinking and the liberal, creative, and performing arts
Places collaborative, project-based learning at the center of the educational experience
Takes full advantage of our School.
